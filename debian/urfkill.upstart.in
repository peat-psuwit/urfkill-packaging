    # If this is a touch device, we have to wait until Android property system
    # is up AND the properties are loaded.

    # If using getprop alone, it can fallback to /system/build.prop, thus not
    # ensuring the property is up. Some device (e.g. krillin) uses property
    # service to control wifi, thus this is required.

    # In the other hand, properties can be loaded after the socket appears (at
    # least in Halium 7.1). If not waiting for that, we might miss the urfkill.

    # last one exists for all devices, so we should eventually get out of the
    # loop).
